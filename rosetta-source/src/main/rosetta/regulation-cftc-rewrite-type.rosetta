                - Modify: An action that modifies the state of a previously submitted transaction (e.g., credit event) or changes a term of a previously submitted transaction due to a newly negotiated modification (amendment) or updates previously missing information (e.g., post price swap). It does not include correction of a previous transaction.
                - Correct: An action that corrects erroneous data of a previously submitted transaction.
                - Error: An action of cancellation of a wrongly submitted entire transaction in case it never came into existence or was not subject to part 43/part 45 reporting requirements but was reported erroneously.
                - Terminate: An action that closes an existing transaction because of a new event (e.g., Compression, Novation). This does not apply to transactions that terminate at contractual maturity date.
                - Revive: An action that reinstates a swap transaction that was reported as error or terminated by mistake.
                - Transfer out: An action that transfers swap transaction from one SDR to another SDR (change of swap data repository).
                - Valuation: An update to valuation data. There will be no corresponding Event type.

Events may include, but are not limited to, trade, novation, compression or risk reduction exercise, early termination, clearing, exercise, allocation, clearing and allocation, credit event, and transfer.
                - Trade: A creation, modification, or termination of a transaction.
                - Novation: A novation legally moves partial or all of the financial risks of a swap from a transferor to a transferee and has the effect of terminating/modifying the original transaction and creating a new transaction to identify the exposure between the transferor/transferee and remaining party.
                - Compression or Risk Reduction Exercise: Compressions and risk reduction exercises generally have the effect of terminating or modifying (i.e., reducing the notional value) a set of existing transactions and of creating a set of new transaction(s). These processes result in largely the same exposure of market risk that existed prior to the event for the counterparty.
                - Early termination: Termination of an existing swap transaction prior to scheduled termination or maturity date.
                - Clearing: Central clearing is a process where a derivatives clearing organization interposes itself between counterparties to contracts, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. It has the effect of terminating an existing transaction between the buyer and the seller and thereby ensuring the performance of open contracts.
                - Exercise: The process by which a counterparty fully or partially exercises their rights specified in the contract of an option or a swaption.
                - Allocation: The process by which an agent, having facilitated a single swap transaction on behalf of several clients, allocates a portion of the executed swap to the clients.
                - Clearing and Allocation: A simultaneous clearing and allocation event in a derivatives clearing organization.
                - Credit event: An event or trigger that results in the modification of the state of a previously submitted credit derivative transaction. Applies only to credit derivatives.
                - Transfer: The process by which a swap is transferred to another SDR that  has the effect of the closing of the swap transaction at one SDR or opening of the same swap transaction using the same UTI/USI in a different SDR (new)."]

                TR Answer 1 (b) These financial instruments should be classified as interest rates, in line with current market practice. On the sections to be reported, ESMA finds that where both sections are relevant having in mind the terms of the contract being reported, both sections of reporting fields are to be reported i.e.option and interest rate for swaption, Caps and Floors, and FX and interest rate or crosscurrency swaps. The contract type (Field 1 of Table 2) should be populated with the value ST for swaption.There are two fields for the notional amount currency and one for the notional amount. To avoid that one counterparty reports the notional amount in CCY1 (Field 9 of Table 2) while the other would report in CCY2 (Field 10 of Table 2), which would create a reconciliation problem, the Field Notional Amount (Field 20 of Table 2) should be denominated in the currency reported in Notional currency 1 (Field 9 of Table 2).
            (c) Total Return Swaps should be classified based on the underlying. For example, a Total Return Swap on an equity index should be reported with value EQ in field Asset class (Table 2 field 2), whereas a Total Return Swap on a bond or loan should be reported with value CR in field Asset class (Table 2 field 2)."]
