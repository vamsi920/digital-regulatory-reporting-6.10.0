Such aggregation is feasible if the work on standardisation and harmonisation of important data elements [is] completed.2 Since November 2014, the CPMI and IOSCO working group for the harmonisation of key OTC derivatives data elements (Harmonisation Group) has worked to develop global guidance regarding the definition, format and usage of key OTC derivatives data elements reported to TRs, including the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI), the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) and other critical data elements. Technical Guidance on the Harmonisation of the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) was published in February 20173 and Technical Guidance on the Harmonisation of the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) was published in September 2017.4 The CPMI and IOSCO also published consultative reports on a first, a second and a third batch of critical data elements other than UTI and UPI in September 2015, October 2016 and June 2017, respectively">
